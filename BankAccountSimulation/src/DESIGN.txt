okay so to begin with bank account simulation

1. bank-account object is created
2. A transaction is performed on it
3. Transaction history has to be maintained using transaction file
4.  Lets create a users.txt to save user data
5. Also user,balance must be stored in another text file
6. the transaction records are maintained in a special file in time order , so when an account number is called the account number, time, deposit/withdrawl, amount is displayed..



So the classes will be
1. User
2. Transaction (deposit or withdrawl)

 file writing...
